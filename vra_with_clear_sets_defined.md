Keep `dp0bond0` for internal and `dp0bpnd1` for external facing routes. Softlayer generally provides these subnets `/26 on BCR` and `/29 on FCR` vlans. By default they are set up like this: 
```
set interfaces bonding dp0bond0 address '10.111.222.61/26'
set interfaces bonding dp0bond0 lacp-options activity 'active'
set interfaces bonding dp0bond0 mode 'lacp'

```
By default the whole plane is in 1 VRRP Group as seen above, as you add routed through VLANs from Cloud Interface, you can see them as below (if they do not appear, you probably have to add them as shows).
```
set interfaces bonding dp0bond0 vif 2011 address '10.123.231.65/26'
